  "Support for parsing manifest files with OSGi metadata. The manifest is an example of a
  single 'layer' of dependency information. Another fitting term would be 'connector' since
  these types of functions produce collections of edges, effectively linking nodes together.

  Note: While in alpha, the terminology to describe things is still subject to iteration.

  The public API supports specifying a path to a manifest file or supplying the file's content
  as a string directly. The result is a map representing the attributes in the manifest. Most
  values are either a standalone string or a coll of strings. The strings in colls tend to be
  fully qualified Java packages/classes/interfaces or Maven artifact names. One noteworthy
  exception is ::Embedded-Artfacts which still retains its properties from the manifest value.

  Regarding the OSGi-specific metadata, all properties describing packages/classes/interfaces
  have been filtered out and are not currently supported. This includes:
  * Version ranges
  * Blueprint properties
  * Service filters
  * Schema information

  The current capabilities are sufficient that a crude bundle graph could be generated from the
  data."
